A REGEX script for DOS batch files on on the command line

I did not write, nor do I take any credit for this script.  It was provided by dbenham on a stack overflow question, and I use it extensively, so I thought I should post it on GIT for others to use as well.

If it breaks, you get to keep both parts.
